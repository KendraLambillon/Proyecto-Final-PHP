This is my final project regarding PHP and SQL, where I have to create a website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, SQL and PHP.

The website will contain:
- A database
- Website with visitor view
- Website with user view
- Website with administrator view


I have used the following tools regarding the Front-End development:
